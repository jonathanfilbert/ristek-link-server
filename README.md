## Architecture

The architecture of this product is consisted of 2 parts:

`frontend` is the folder containing the front end part of the app. It's a React app that has a serverless function that communicates with the server to do the actual storage and retrieval process of the shorten url. It is then

```markdown
Stacks

- Next.JS (main React app framework)
- Typescript (language used)
- Tailwind CSS (utility css classes used to style and theme the app)
- Chakra-UI (UI components used at various places, including toasts and some entrance animation)
```

`server` is the folder containing the serverless function running on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to execute the shortening and retrieval process, [Cloudflare K/V](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-kv-is-ga/) is then used as a distributed edge database to store every single urls.
